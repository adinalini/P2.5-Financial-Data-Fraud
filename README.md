##Finding the Frauds

As the world moves toward a cashless, cloud-based reality, the banking sector is under greater threat than ever. The global cost of credit card fraud is expected to soar above $32 billion by 2020. While it’s a major problem, fraud only accounts for a minute fraction of the total number of transactions happening every day. This gives rise to another problem: imbalanced data.

In machine learning, fraud is viewed as a classification problem, and when you’re dealing with imbalanced data, it means the issue to be predicted is in the minority. As a result, the predictive model will often struggle to produce real business value from the data, and it can sometimes get it wrong.
